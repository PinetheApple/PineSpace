# Whamazon

This challenge is rather simple, but it's quite easy to overthink it. All we have to do is buy the flag from "Whamazon".  The only issue is that the flag costs $10000000000 but we only have $50 to start with. So currently, with the money we have, we can't buy the flag nor the house (not that we need the house).

May as well buy an apple with what we have right now. Since it's only $3, we'll be left with $47.

It looks like the store is simply multiplying the amount that we specified with the cost of an item and subtracting that "cost" from the current balance. But it might not be checking the quantity that is being specified. What if we buy a negative amount of things (say, video games in this case)?

Well, that wasn't so hard! With the money that we now have, we can easily buy a flag (or two).

Now, all that's left is to check the inventory for the flag.
