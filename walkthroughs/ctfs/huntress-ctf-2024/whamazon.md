This challenge is rather simple, but it's also quite easy to overthink it. All you have to do is buy the flag from "Whamazon".  The only issue is that the flag costs $10000000000 but you only have $50 to use. So currently, with the money you have, you can't buy the flag nor the house (not that you need the house).

May as well buy an apple with what you have right now. Since it's only $3, you'll be left with $47.

It looks like that store is simply multiplying the amount that you specified with the cost of an item and subtracting that "cost" from your current balance. But it might not be checking the quantity that is being specified. What if you buy a negative amount of things (say, video games in this case)?

Well, that wasn't so hard! With the money that you now have, you can easily buy a flag (or two).

Now, all that's left is to check the inventory for the flag.
