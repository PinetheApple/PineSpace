After a bit of looking around online, I managed to find out that it was actually code in "COW", a programming language. You can learn more about it at - [https://bigzaphod.github.io/COW/](https://bigzaphod.github.io/COW/).

There happens to be an online tool to decrypt the language. Using this tool, you can get the flag to the challenge.
